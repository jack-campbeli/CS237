The time (in minutes) it takes to make and sell a sub depends on the type of order, and we model it as a real number chosen uniformly and independently at random from the interval [0,15]. For simplicity, we will assume that only one order is processed at a time, and that each order is placed in the exact moment in which the previous sub is ready. \n",
